              "content": "\nOkay, the user wants a simple question with a single correct answer. Let me think of something straightforward. Maybe a basic math problem? Like addition or subtraction. Or perhaps a common knowledge question.\n\nHmm, math questions can sometimes have nuances, but \"What is 2 + 2?\" seems simple. The answer is 4. But wait, should I check if there's any context where 2+2 isn't 4? No, in standard arithmetic, it's always 4. That's pretty safe.\n\nAlternatively, a question like \"What is the capital of France?\" The answer would be Paris. That's another good option. It's a common fact and has a single correct answer. Or maybe a question about colors, like \"What color is the sky on a sunny day?\" Answer: Blue.\n\nWait, the user specified a single correct answer. The sky question might have exceptions, like different colors at sunset or in different planets. Maybe Paris as the capital of France is better. There's no ambiguity there.\n\nOr a science question, like \"What is the chemical symbol for water?\" H2O. That's correct. Or \"How many planets are in our solar system?\" Answer: Eight, since Pluto was reclassified. That's a fixed fact now.\n\nAnother idea: \"What is the largest mammal in the world?\" Blue whale. That's accurate and one answer. But maybe the user wants something even more basic.\n\nLet me go with math first. \"What is 5 multiplied by 6?\" Answer: 30. That's straightforward. Or \"What is 10 minus 3?\" Answer: 7. But maybe the multiplication is better because subtraction could have different contexts (like negative numbers, but probably not if it's assumed basic).\n\nWait, the user wants a simple question. 2+2=4 is simplest. It's almost universal. I'll present that as a candidate. Alternatively, a question like \"Which number is the smallest?\" with options. But the user didn't mention options, just a question needing a single correct answer. So either a question that calculates to a number, like a math problem, or a factual recall.\n\nIn the interest of simplicity, maybe \"What is 2 + 2?\" with answer 4. Or maybe a question like \"What is the sum of the angles in a triangle?\" where the answer is 180 degrees. That's another one.\n\nBut 2+2 is more accessible. Almost everyone knows that. Let's go with that. I need to make sure there's only one correct answer. Yep, 4 is correct. No other answer is valid. Alright, that's the question.\n",
